# Data sets

There are three different data sets that are used in the experiments of the above mentioned paper:

- The main data set which derives from the combination of PolArt and CELEX.
It combines (i)  words from PolArt for which a morphological parse existed in CELEX with (ii) additional words taken from CELEX for which we added polarity annotations. The new words from CELEX were added so as to have a more sizable  share of the neutral class in the overall data set.
The main data set is split up into a train/test part (8400 items) and a dev(elopment) part (900) items.

To reconstitute this dataset you need to obtain PolArt** (free) and CELEX (licensed by LDC: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc96l14). Our own license above does not cover these additional resources.

** We downloaded PolArt a while ago from
http://kitt.cl.uzh.ch/kitt/polart/

A successor/update is now available here:
http://bics.sentimental.li/files/8614/2462/8150/german.lex


- To go along with the polarity information for simple and complex words from PolArt, we also created polarity annotations for affixes.

- The Wortwarte (wortwarte.de) data set contains a random sample of items identified as neologisms by the Wortwarte project. We created polarity annotations and morphological parses for these items.

-  The third data set are compounds taken from the German version of Wiktionary. These items were also annotated for polarity by us and we provided morphological parses for these items if they were not already covered by CELEX.
